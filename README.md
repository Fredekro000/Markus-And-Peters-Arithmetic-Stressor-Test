# Markus-And-Peters-Arithmetic-Stressor-Test
Markus And Peters Arithmetic Stressor Test (MPA Test) is a mentally math test, where participants has to mentally keep track of different math equations

Foreword, this program was made in collaboration with ChatGPT. 

Currently, there is a bug, sometimes when participants have written a wrong answer but not have not submitted, then the text will flash green, and still say `incorrect'.

I do not take any credit for the idea of the program, this was purely made because I couldn't find any online or downloadable version.
Full credit goes to the creators of the stress test. Here is a link to the source I used: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4530(97)00082-6
